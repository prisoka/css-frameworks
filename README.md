## What are you looking at? 

After 2 weeks that I've started watching online JS tutorials, I was playing around with HTML, CSS and JS, and wrote this simple page to put in practice what I was learning. I am proud that I was able to complete it in few hours, with no previous programming experience.

## Time:
Completed in a couple of hours. 

## Skills Learned: 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Surge to deploy.

## Task:
For this assessment you will be creating a basic html file and styling it with only a CSS Framework like Bootstrap or Materialize. Your assignment must meet the following requirements:

* [ ] Include Bootstrap, Materialize or a similar framework
* [ ] Include a nav
* [ ] Include a footer
* [ ] Include a multi-column layout
* [ ] The Nav must collapse when the window shrinks
* [ ] Mobile-first design
